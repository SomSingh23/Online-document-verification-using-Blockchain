## **Abstract**

One of the most important documents is certificates for graduates from universities and other educational institutions. A certificate is a certificate of qualification for a graduate that is used for a job or other matters relating. Advancement of IT and low cost and high quality office supplies on the marketplace have contributed to the development of essential documents such as certificates, identification cards and passports. However, it is costly and time consuming to check certificates using traditional methods.

The aim of this paper is to introduce a theoretical/small working model, which can give the possible solution for the issue and verification of degital certificates using blockchain based. There are many functions such as hash, digital signatures and work evidence in blockchain technology.

The models formulate a system divided into two principal Firstly, the system uses Python code to convert a digital certificate, of any format, into binary data. User information is then added to this binary data, which is used as input for the SHA 256 algorithm. This ensures that the data is secure and cannot be tampered with.

Secondly, the system involves adding this data to the node and incorporating it into the blockchain network on Corda. This is achieved through the use of smart contracts and consensus algorithms, which validate the authenticity of the certificate and ensure that it is added to the blockchain securely.

By incorporating these two principles, the proposed system aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for digital certificate verification, preventing certificate fraud and ensuring that the qualifications of individuals are authenticated accurately. The use of blockchain technology offers several benefits, including the ability to create tamper-proof and transparent records that can be accessed and verified easily.
